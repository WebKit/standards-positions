# WebKit's positions on emerging web specifications

## What is this Repository?

The [WebKit Open Source Project](https://webkit.org) uses [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions) to come to consensus on various Web standards proposals. Once we've come to consensus, we publish our positions on the [WebKit Feature Status page](https://webkit.org/status/).

Please [file an issue](https://github.com/WebKit/standards-positions/issues/new) if you'd like us to generate a position on some web-facing API.

For previous positions see the [webkit-dev mailing list archives](https://lists.webkit.org/pipermail/webkit-dev/).

### Possible positions

Only once a label is assigned to an issue does it represent WebKit's position.
Individual responses to issues do not represent the WebKit team's position on a standard or feature.
Positions are not final. We are happy to revisit positions as new information becomes available.

- `support` - WebKit sees this specification as conceptually good, and worth prototyping, getting feedback on its value, and iterating.
- `neutral` - WebKit does not see this specification as harmful, but is not convinced that it is a good approach or worth working on.
- `oppose` - WebKit considers this specification to be harmful in its current state.
- `under consideration` - WebKit's position on this specification is being worked out and is not yet settled.
- `not considering` - WebKit does not intend to look at this specification in the near future.

#### Other possible issue states

- `invalid` - The issue is not about a specification which would be implemented in a browser engine such as WebKit.
- `duplicate` - The issue is a duplicate of another issue.
